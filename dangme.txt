Well here I sit a-high, gettin' ideas, 
Ain't nothing but a fool would live like this 
Out all night and runnin' wild 
Woman sittin' home with a month old child 
Dang me, dang me 
They oughta take a rope and hang me 
High from the highest tree 
Woman would you weep for me. 
Just sittin' around drinkin' with the rest of the guys 
Six rounds bought, and I bought five 
Spent the groceries and half the rent 
Like fourteen dollars and twenty seven cents. 
They say roses are red and violets are purple 
Sugar is sweet and so is maple surple 
Well I'm the seventh out of seven sons 
My pappy was a pistol 
I'm a son of a gun.
