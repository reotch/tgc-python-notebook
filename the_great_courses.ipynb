    "### Parameters\n",
    "Parameters are the main way to get info into a function. They are passed in during a function call. **They are seen within the function as variables**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope\n",
    "A variable is \"in scope\" when it is defined and usable. A variable in a function is \"out of scope\" from the main program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory and a Program\n",
    "Consider this demo and look at what happens in memory.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def maxdemo(val1, val2):\n",
    "    if val1 > val2:\n",
    "        return val1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return val2\n",
    "    \n",
    "a = 1\n",
    "b = 2\n",
    "c = maxdemo(a, b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In main memory, the first thing that happens is that variable `a` is assigned the value 1. Then `b` assigned to 2. Then when the function is called it is put in *temporary memory*, or *function activation record*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local variables 'val1' and 'val2' are created in the function activation record into new memory locations. After the function executes it is moved out of memory. The function activation record is destroyed and the program moves on to the next line in the main program.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write functions without worrying that a variable in scope will interfere with a variable with the same name that is out of scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, however, the variable `a` is available for reading from the main program.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def testscore(numcorrect, total):\n",
    "    numcorrect += a\n",
    "    temp_value = numcorrect / total\n",
    "    return temp_value * 100\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 12\n",
    "b = 20\n",
    "c = testscore(a, b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is because there is no locally defined variable `a` defined within the function activation record. It goes back to the main program for the most recent assigned vaule to `a` and is still considered \"in scope\" **for reading**. If we try to assign something to `a` it would be a new variable in the function activation record. This is considered bad practice though. If you want to use a variable from the main program, it is best to declare it as a *global variable* in the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Global Variables\n",
    "When a variable is defined as a global variable in the function it is the same variable as the main program.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def initialize():\n",
    "    global fuellevel\n",
    "    fuellevel = 100.0\n",
    "    \n",
    "fuellevel = 0\n",
    "initialize()\n",
    "print(fuellevel)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Without `global` being declared within the function, `print(fuellevel)` would print 0. Now that it is using the variable from the main program, it is affecting the variable in the main program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Declaring a variable as `global` is generally discouraged but there are some uses where it is useful:\n",
    "- initializing values\n",
    "- read in data and set up variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mutable Variables\n",
    "Variables can be mutable (changable when passed as a parameter) or immutable (not changable when passed as a parameter). `int`, `float`, and `str` are immutable variable types. Lists are a mutable variable type. If a variable is immutable, a function cannot change it. If it is mutable the function can change the value. "
